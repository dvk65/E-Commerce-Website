 WAMP data-base is used. The project folder should be saved in the www folder of WAMP.<br>
 The port number is 3005 in my case. Adjust that according to you.<br>
 A few pages like settings.php, cart-remove.php,cart-add.php, success.php are yet to be added.<br>
 Feel free to make changes and any reviews are appreciated.<br>
